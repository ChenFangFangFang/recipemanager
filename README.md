   - Add, edit, delete, and view family recipes stored in a database.
   - Support for tagging recipes (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, or all).
   - Include detailed descriptions for each recipe.

2. **Meal Tracking and Planning**:
   - Record daily meals and create plans for future meals.
   - Monitor meal frequency to track how often each recipe is used, both weekly and monthly.

   - Suggest a random recipe from the database when users need inspiration for their next meal.

#### Architecture:
- Built with **Spring Boot** for a modular and maintainable backend.
- Uses **Spring Security** for authentication and user management.
- Incorporates **JPA Repositories** for database interactions, making CRUD operations seamless.
